## Web-Development
This course uses web development as a vehicle for developing skills in rapid prototyping. 
Students acquire the skills to build a Linux web server in **Apache**, to write a web site from scratch in **PHP**, 
to run an **SQL** database, to perform scripting in **Python**, to employ the **AngularJS** web framework, and to develop 
modern web applications in client-side and server-side **JavaScript**. The course culminates with a creative project 
in which students are able to synthesize the course material into a project of their own interest.
