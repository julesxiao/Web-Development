### Intro
* In Module 6 you will create a multi-room chat server using Node.JS and Socket.IO. This project must be completed using Node.JS.

* This chat service will contain a main lobby where users sign on with a nickname and can communicate with each other. Users may also create chat rooms for other to join. The entire app should be displayed on a single webpage, listing the room you are in, all available rooms, and the users in the current room.

### Instruction  
* Type `node server.js`   
* The arrow on the top right corner is to join a room.  
* The plus symbol is to create a new room.   
* Click on any user(except the user itself) listed in the right panel in the Users section would send a private message to that user.

### Other functions
* Display the number of unread messages, which is shown on the left panel following the rooms(in the Room section) and the user names(in the PM section)  
* Send images while chatting  
* Send emoji while chatting
