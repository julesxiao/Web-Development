1. Intro
In the group portion of Module 6 you will create a multi-room chat server using Node.JS and Socket.IO. This project must be completed using Node.JS.

This chat service will contain a main lobby where users sign on with a nickname and can communicate with each other. Users may also create chat rooms for other to join. The entire app should be displayed on a single webpage, listing the room you are in, all available rooms, and the users in the current room.

The single room chat server and client are provided here: Socket.IO
